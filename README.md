# profileViewsBoost
This just boost your views in your readme.md
## Why?
A friend asked to me to create this and, i mean, it's simple so, why not? I dont even have a view counter, i had to test it to someone else.
## How does it works
After inserting the username of a github user, it checks if there is a view counter and, if yes, take the link of the view counter and spam it of get requests.
## How to use it
- Install python 
- python main.py
or
- python main.py --username name --times times --delay delay --threads threads
